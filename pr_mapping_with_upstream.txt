This text file is mainly a lookup help for DB-Manul developers to quickly check if a certain upstream pull request
has already been merged into DB-Manul.

There is no automatic sorting mechanism for this file. Please keep it tidy and sorted descending by Liquibase pull
request number (pr#) to maximise its usefulness. Thank you.

                       before I can fully merge it.

681     N/A            Support for Actian Ingress RDBMS - work probably already included in #683.
678     MERGED         Add SchemesCDIConfig+ (it should allow you to create a dependent tree…

671     N/A            [CORE-3051] ASANY supports no CASCADE in DROP TABLE

669     (TODO)         Sets class name in CustomWrapper classes must be normalized.
                       (upstream unit tests fail with this and my expertise has not advanced enough to
                       understand / fix it myself)
668     MERGED         Bug fix for null pointer
667     MERGED         Adding logic to persist full hierarchy of context expressions into databasechangelog table
666     MERGED         refactoring: extract methods, decrease level on indention
665     (TODO)         SAP/Sybase ASE: Liquibase change
                       Failed to merge, the code base is too far off mine. Asked the original author if he is interested
                       in rebasing it.
664     MERGED         [CORE-3013] replaces "error in yaml" with "error in file <FILENAME>"

661     MERGED         [CORE-3020] No warning when included file doesn't exist
660     (TODO)         [CORE-3010] MySQL Add Default Value failed
                       In general, ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT works in MySQL/MariaDB - maybe
                       the problem only happens with certain expressions for defaultValue?
659     MERGED         [CORE-3009] ASANY Drop Default Value failed
658     GONE
657     GONE
656     MERGED         [CORE-2993] createSequence with order enabled for DB2
655     MERGED         [CORE-2773] Detection of DB2/AS400 improved
654     REJECTED       Mark failed changeset executions in the databasechangelog
                       The behaviour changes so that the same change set is not executed again until the identifier
                       changes - I don't think that's a good thing, it makes bugfixing of changesets inconvenient
                       for developers
653     N/A            [CORE-3003] SQLAnywhere: Owner/Schema-Identifier at index-names not allowed
                       -> already fixed in DB-Manul
652     N/A            [CORE-3002] SQLAnywhere: DROP UNIQUE CONSTRAINT fails
                       -> already fixed in DB-Manul
651     N/A            Does not apply to DB-Manul because dropAllForeignKeys has been completely rewritten and no
                       DBMS-specific generators exist for that anymore.
650     MERGED         [CORE-3000] BatchInsertExecutablePreparedStatement merged, but with modifications to make it
                       work with all JDBC drivers that support batching, not just Oracle DB.
649     MERGED         Corrected documentation errors in AbstractLiquibaseMojo.java
648     MERGED         [CORE-1852] checksum depends on line endings and startCommentSymbol
647     MERGED         [CORE-3005] Consideration of DB2 system views
646     N/A            [CORE-3006] probably already fixed in DB-Manul by another fix; needs verification
645     GONE
644     N/A            [CORE-2978] Broken PostgreSQL AddAutoIncrementChange SQL code generation
                       (likely already fixed by another checkin)
643     GONE
642     MERGED         [CORE-2977] Use the same name as Postgres for primary key constraints
641     GONE
640     N/A            Could not reproduce the problem with the current DB-Manul codebase. Added an integration test
                       for it (commit #f6e83948c9f235ac45d30e9dd8cc4c9f75de70a3). It may be that I misunderstood the
                       problem description - please contact me if that is the case.

634     MERGED         [CORE-2989]: Custom change: configure change before calling getConfirmationMessage
633     (TODO)         [CORE-2965] allow any additional attributes for the change elements in … #633
                       proposal looks good, but I am a little worried about
                       <xsd:anyAttribute namespace="##any"/> - before I merge it, I need to confirm that ##any does
                       not cause invalid attribute names from the changeset-3.6.xsd to pass as valid. Maybe
                       <xsd:anyAttribute namespace="##other"/> would serve the same purpose? Need to investigate.
632     REJECTED       [CORE-2162] MSSQL: Multiple inserts in sqlFile do not fail as expected.
                       The problem here is that multiple DML commands should never go into a single
                       java.sql.Statement.execute call. Therefore, I think that [CORE-2162] is not a valid bug.
631     MERGED         Fix for "Different object quoting strategies are used for validation and execution of a
                       ChangeSet."
630     TODO           Trigger an exception on a RAISERROR - the idea looks good, but I still fail to find a test
                       case where a single executed statement returns multiple result sets. I need that to make a
                       test case to protect against regression.
629     MERGED         [CORE-2944] Honor `outputDefaultSchema=false` and `outputDefaultCatalog=false` when generating
                       SQL code.
628     MERGED         Fix for whitespace before delimiter
627     GONE
626     MERGED         Postgres does not support parameters for type int
625     TODO           --do-not-warn-about--DBA_RECYCLEBIN the idea is legitimate, but I would rather have it
                       implemented as a proper command line option (in the classes Main and CommandLineUtils, so that
                       it can be used from Maven/Ant/etc. as well). I also found the queries where the recycle bin is
                       used, maybe I can work around the need to access to it.
624     DUPLICATE      Don't hardcode version dependencies using 'Class-Path:' in MANIFEST.MF - 4.0.x (I could not
                       find a Liquibase 4.x.x branch that is more current than the master branch, so I use the 3.5.x
                       version of the same PR:
623     MERGED         Don't hardcode version dependencies using 'Class-Path:' in MANIFEST.MF - 3.5.x
622     DUPLICATE      Another version of #623 (already merged)
621     MERGED         Fix some required fields in the preconditions
620     N/A            Made ChangeWithColumns extend Change so that an extension would have …
                       It seems the original author did not want to merge that change any more (from what he wrote
                       in his comments), but did not delete the PR. Skipping it for now.
