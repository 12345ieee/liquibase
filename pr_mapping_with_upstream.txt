                       understand / fix it myself)

                       Failed to merge, the code base is too far off mine. Asked the original author if he is interested

660     (TODO)         [CORE-3010] MySQL Add Default Value failed
                       In general, ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT works in MySQL/MariaDB - maybe
                       the problem only happens with certain expressions for defaultValue?

654     REJECTED       Mark failed changeset executions in the databasechangelog
                       The behaviour changes so that the same change set is not executed again until the identifier
                       changes - I don't think that's a good thing, it makes bugfixing of changesets inconvenient
                       for developers
