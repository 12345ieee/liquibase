                    <h2>Database Refactoring With LiquiBase</h2>
                    <p>LiquiBase is an open source (LGPL), DBMS-independent library for
                        tracking, managing and applying database changes.  It is built on a simple premise:
                        <em>All database changes (structure and data) are stored in an XML-based
                        descriptive manner and checked into source control.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While there have been many attempts to provide a similar tool, LiquiBase aims to provide a solution that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supports merging of changes from multiple developers</li>
                        <li>Works well with code branches</li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Isn't DBMS-specific</li>
                        <li>Allows you to manage production data as well as various test datasets</li>
                        <li>Works in an environment where multiple machines will be attempting to migrate the database concurrently</li>
                        <li>Supports automated change-applying or generation of SQL scripts that can be approved and applied by a DBA</li>
                        <li>Supports <a href="manual/latest/rollback.html">rolling back changes</a></li>
                        <li>Can create <a href="manual/latest/diff.html">database "diff"s</a> and can generate change logs from them
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While we are currently focused on the core Java-based migrator functionality, additional features  planned include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data extraction for generating test datasets</li>
                        <li>Unit testing infrastructure</li>
                        <li>.Net support</li>
