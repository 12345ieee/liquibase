                        Due to variations in data types and SQL syntax, the following databases are currently supported:
                    </p>
                    <table class="databaseCompatibiltyTable">
                        <tr><th>MySQL</th><td>No Issues</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>PostgreSQL</th><td>8.2+ is required to use the "drop all database objects" functionality.</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>Oracle</th><td>No Issues</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>MS-SQL</th><td>No Issues</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>Sybase</th><td>ASE 12.0+ required.  "ddl in trans" database option needs to be set (including on tempdb). "select into" and "allow null by default" database options needs to be set.</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>DB2</th><td>No Issues.  Will auto-call REORG when nessisary.</td></tr>
                        <tr><th>Apache Derby</th><td>No Issues</td></tr>

                    <h2>Using Unsupported Databases</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since LiquiBase is built on top of standard JDBC, the only ties it has to the underlying database is
                        through the SQL that can vary from DBMS to DBMS.  If you attempt to use LiquiBase with an unsupported
                        database, it will try to run and will most likely succeed.  The only problem you are likely to run into is
                        the current date/time function name.  If LiquiBase is unable to determine the correct date/time function,
                        you can pass it in via the currentDateTimeFunction arguement
                        (see <a href="manual/latest/command_line_migrator.html">command line migrator</a> and <a href="manual/latest/ant.html">Ant migrator</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may also run into problem with the SQL generated by the change/refactoring tags on unsupported databases.
                        The best way to deal with this problem is to first try the standard change/refactoring tags.
                        If it generates an error, you can fall back to the <a href="manual/latest/sql_change.html">&lt;sql&gt;</a> tag to code whatever change you need
                        to make in a way that your database understands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, for some reason, the DatabaseChangeLog table cannot be created on your database, the base creation SQL that you can modify
                        to suite your needs is:
                    </p>
                    <pre>CREATE TABLE DATABASECHANGELOG (id varchar(150) not null,
author varchar(150) not null,
filename varchar(255) not null,
dateExecuted datetime not null,
md5sum varchar(32),
description varchar(255),
comments varchar(255),
tag varchar(255),
liquibase varchar(10),
primary key(id, author, filename))</pre>
                    <p>
                        Reasons for creating the DatabaseChangeLog table yourself include database that require null fields to be specified as such 
                        and index limitations that don't allow primary keys on fields as long.  You can change the data types and or data type lengths
                        all you want, LiquiBase simply checks for the existence of the table.
