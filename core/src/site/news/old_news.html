                    <h2>4/25/2007 - LiquiBase 0.8.1 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        0.8.1 fixes a bug related to running LiquiBase without specifing an execution context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also changed prompting on non-localhost databases to be "false" by default, but made it
                        an option in the command-line migrator.

                    <p>
                        With version 0.8, we have finished the LiquiBase name change and completed our move to
                        SourceForge.
                        We have also added many useful new features including:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Change Log Preconditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Preconditions can be specified at the beginning of each change log to both document and enforce
                        assumptions the writers of the changelog had when creating it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently supported preconditions check the type of database (MySQL vs. PostgreSQL)
                        and the username of the database connection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../manual/latest/preconditions.html">More on preconditions</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Execution contexts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Change Sets can now be tagged with a "context" in which to run. This allows you to control
                        which will be executed in any particular migration run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contexts can be used to ease management of test data sets and to allow you to more easily
                        create a single change log that is compatible with multiple DBMS systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="../manual/latest/contexts.html">More on contexts</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>failOnError</h3>
                    <p>
                        ChangeSets can now have a "failOnError" attribute which controls if errors executing the
                        changeset will cause the entire database migration to fail or not.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Add/Drop Not-Null Constraints</h3>
                    <p>
                        Two new refactorings have been added: "addNotNullConstraint" and "dropNotNullConstraint"
                    </p>
                    <h3>Comment tags in change sets</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added a "comment" tag.  Currently it is just ignored, but future releases may
                        make use of it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Improved documentation</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have officially launched <a href="http://www.liquibase.org">http://www.liquibase.org</a>
                        with greatly improved documentation.  The documentation is also included in the downloaded .zip
                        files as well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Many, Many Bug Fixes</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we approach 1.0, we have added an expanded set of unit and integration tests which have helped
                        us flush out many bugs and will continue to make sure that old issues do not resurface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would like to thank Thilak Kumar Rajaraman, Ramachandra Kadam, and Yashwanth Potla for the
                        contributions they have made to this version of LiquiBase.

                    <h2>3/16/2007 - LiquiBase 0.7 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce LiquiBase, the newly-renamed Sundog Database Refactoring Tool. We were
                        never really fond of the SDRT name and finally found one we like better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 0.7 version is primarily focused around the name conversion.
                        It has a new package structure based on liquibase.* rather than net.sundog.db.*.
                        We are also working on updating our website and moving much of the project management
                        information to
                        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase">
                            http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase</a>
                        .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the name change, the following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added support for autoIncrement columns in createTableChange</li>
                        <li>Better support for multi-line SQL scripts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Note: DUE THE THE CHANGE IN MULTI-LINE SQL HANDLING, YOU MUST REBUILD YOUR MD5SUMS.
                        Execute "update databasechangelog set md5sum=null" to clear out your past md5sums.
                        They will be rebuilt with new correct new versions the next time your run the migrator.
                    </p>

                    <p>Version 0.6.1 of the LGPL Sundog Database Refactoring Tool has been released. This is
                        primarily a bug fix release with some minor feature additions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues resolved include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classpath for command line migrator can now include .ear files</li>
                        <li>Can specify a "database.migrator.should.run" system property that blocks the
                            migrator from running if set to "false"</li>

                        <li>Added a net.sundog.db.migrator.servlet.MigratorStatusServlet servlet that can used to see
                            the migrator logs</li>
                        <li>Added a MIGRATOR_FAIL_ON_ERROR web.xml context parameter that controls if an exception
                            should be raised if an exception is thrown, or if the listener should just return.
                            Throws an exception by default</li>
                        <li>All database SQL is upper case.</li>
                        <li>Fixed issues with postgres schemas and getTables() call</li>

                    <h2>11/10/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.6 Released</h2>
                    <p>Version 0.6 of the LGPL Sundog Database Refactoring Tool has been released. The primary new
                        feature of this release is support for distributed locking among processes. This is
                        especially useful when using the ServletMigrator with clustered application servers or other
                        times you have multiple clients connecting to the same database.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, for some reason, a client crashes without cleaning up its lock, they can be queried and
                        removed via the command-line migrator's "-listLocks" and "-releaseLocks"
                        or by querying and updating the "DatabaseChangeLogLock" table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the locking system, this release includes several bug fixes including one that kept
                        database URLs with "=" signs in them from working.

                    <p>After several months of development, the Sundog Database Refactoring tool version 0.5 has been
                        released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most significant change is switching to an LGPL license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Beyond licensing changes, major changes include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Major code cleanup, including removing all 3rd party dependencies
                        </li>

                        <li>Command line migrator can be run directly against WAR and EAR files</li>
                        <li>Command line migrator can be run simply via "java -jar"</li>
                        <li>ChangeSets can be marked as "runAlways" and "runOnChange"</li>
                        <li>ServletListener can be configured to only run on certain hostnames</li>
                        <li>Improved MD5Sum generation.
                            <b>Note: the algorithm to compute MD5Sums changed thereby making existing values invalid.
                                To update your MD5Sums, run "update databasechangelog set md5sum=null" then
                                run the migrator like normal</b>
                        </li>

                        <li>Improved MySQL Support</li>
                        <li>Many additional bugfixes</li>
                        <li>Improved Documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the migrator now requires Java 5.  If there is a large cry for support of
                        1.4, that can be re-evaluated.

                        This initial release focuses on the migrator system which allows you to document your database

                        We have been using the migrator in production so it should be ready for general use.
