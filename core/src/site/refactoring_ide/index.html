                <h2>LiquiBase Database Refactoring IDE</h2>
                <p>
                    LiquiBase is designed with the idea of building an visual tool on top of it to make
                    managing database changes even easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                	We have begun work on an Eclipse plug-in as well as a stand-alone IDE for non-Eclipse users.
                	It is currently alpha-quality, but is under heavy development and does not support all the features planned for the final 1.0 release.
                	Currently, it allows you to apply refactorings to your database as well as update your database from an existing change log file.
                	Future features include a rollback interface, database diff interface, as well as commands for listing tags, checking for checksum errors and more.
