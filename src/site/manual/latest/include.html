                        The include tag allows you to break up your change-logs into more manageable pieces.

  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.0

    &lt;include file="com/example/directory/directory.changelog.xml"/&gt;

                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        As projects grow, the number of changeSets in a changeLog can grow unwieldy.
                        To help ease this problem, and to make management of changes easier, databaseChangeLogs can be included to create a tree of change-logs.
                        In the example above, the root change log includes first the changes in com/example/news/news.changelog.xml then the changes in com/example/directory/directory.changelog.xml.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Included change-logs are run in the order they are found so care does need to be taken to make sure that the included changelogs are either completely independent, or that
                        any required changelogs are run first.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently there is no checking for looping changelogs or double inclusion of changelogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you include a changelog twice, you shouldn't run into problems because the second time around,
                        LiquiBase will know that the changeSets have been ran and won't run them again (unless there is a runAlways tag).
                        Do not rely on this functionality remaining constant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you create a changeLog loop (root.changelog.xml includes news.changelog.xml which includes root.changelog.xml) you will get an infinite loop.
                        Checks for loops is a feature on our list of enhancements, but is currently not implemented
