                    <h2>LiquiBase Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        With LiquiBase, developers store database changes in XML-based files on their local development
                        machines and apply them to their local databases. As those changes
                        get committed to the source control system and are distributed to other developers, changes are
                        applied to those local developer databases, to the integration databases, staging databases, and
                        even to live production databases. Changes may be applied through several methods, either via an
                        Ant task, a command line program, or automatically during application or application server startup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The LiquiBase Migrator is the core system that enables easy development of database applications
                        using an agile methodology. As changes are applied to the local database during development,
                        those revisions are stored in an XML change log file. Each entry in the change log contains an
                        "id" and an "author" attribute. Those two attributes plus the name and location of the
                        change file itself form a unique identifier for a particular change. When the migrator executes,
                        it compares entries in a DatabaseChangeHistory table defined in the database. This table
                        contains the "id", "author", and "file" identifier of all previous changes. If a change in the
                        log file is not in the DatabaseChangeHistory table, the Migrator executes and records the change
                        which will be skipped during future runs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The change log files can be nested together via an INCLUDE tag. This is useful for breaking up
                        changes by component, project, iteration, or whatever method works best for your project.
                    </p>

                        The motivation for creating the tool was further fueled after reading the book
                        <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2238089-10387773?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buy.com%2Fretail%2FProduct.asp%3Fsku%3D31259803%26SearchEngine%3DCJaffiliate%26Type%3DCJ%26Keyword%3D31259803%26Category%3DBook&amp;cjsku=31259803" onClick="javascript:urchinTracker('/book/refactoring');">Refactoring Databases: Evolutionary

                        of refactoring databases in development, and being able to apply those same changes through the
                        live production environment deployment.  While there are many attempts, most break down when working
                        with a group of developers, using code branches, or needing to support multiple different DBMS systems.
