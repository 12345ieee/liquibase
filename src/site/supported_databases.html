                        Due to variations in data types and SQL syntax, the following databases are currently supported:

                    <h2>Using Unsupported Databases</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since LiquiBase is built on top of standard JDBC, the only ties it has to the underlying database is
                        through the SQL that can vary from DBMS to DBMS.  If you attempt to use LiquiBase with an unsupported
                        database, it will try to run and will most likely succeed.  The only problem you are likely to run into is
                        the current date/time function name.  If LiquiBase is unable to determine the correct date/time function,
                        you can pass it in via the currentDateTimeFunction arguement
                        (see <a href="manual/latest/command_line_migrator.html">command line migrator</a> and <a href="manual/latest/ant.html">Ant migrator</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may also run into problem with the SQL generated by the change/refactoring tags on unsupported databases.
                        The best way to deal with this problem is to first try the standard change/refactoring tags.
                        If it generates an error, you can fall back to the <a href="manual/sql_tag.html">&lt;sql&gt;</a> tag to code whatever change you need
                        to make in a way that your database understands.
