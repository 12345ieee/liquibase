                    <p>The current version of the LiquiBase (was Sundog Database Refactoring Tool) is @BUILD.VERSION@.
                        The XML changelog schema is ready for production use as any changes to the
                        schema will be backwards compatible up to and through version 1.0.</p>

                        <h4>Upgrade Notes:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Between 0.8.x and 0.9.0, the Ant task "migrationFiles" parameter changed to "changeLogFile"
                            and no longer supports multiple change logs.</li>
                        <li>Between 0.8.0 and 0.8.1, LiquiBase no longer prompts you if you run it against a non-localhost database.  There is a flag
                        available in the command line migrator and the ant migrator that allows you to turn the functionality back on.</li>
                        <li>Between 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 the location and namespace of the XSD changed.  The old XSD will remain
                        available, but does not contain the most current schema</li>
                        <li>Between 0.6.2 and 0.7.0 there was a change to how MD5Sums were generated for changelogs.
                            When upgrading, you will need to run
                            <em>update databasechangelog set md5sum=null</em>
                            to clear existing MD5Sums. They will be re-generated with the correct values on the
                            next migration</li>
                        <li> Between 0.6.2 and 0.7.0 we began our transition our new "LiquiBase" name
                            Package names changed which should have no impact on end-users beyond a change to the name
                            of the ServletMigrator listener which is now
                            <em>liquibase.migrator.servlet.ServletMigrator.</em></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Requirements</h4>
                    <p>
                        LiquiBase has been designed for Java 1.5 and greater.  There is a package built for 1.4, but it
                        has not been well tested.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Installation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Extract liquibase.zip. In it you will find a <em>liquibase.migrator.jar</em>
                        This jar is all that is needed to run the migration tool from within
                        <a href="manual/latest/ant.html">ant</a>
                        or a
                        <a href="manual/latest/servlet_listener_migrator.html">servlet container</a>.
                        You can run the
                        <a href="manual/latest/command_line_migrator.html">command line</a>
                        version of the migrator with the same jar file by simply using <em>java -jar
                        liquibase.migrator.jar</em>.
                    </p>
