                <h2>LiquiBase Database Refactoring IDE</h2>
                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
                <p>
                    LiquiBase is designed with the idea of building an visual tool on top of it to make
                    managing database changes even easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a prototype application that will hopefully be updated to support the
                    newest migrator changes soon.  It includes the ability to browse and query the database like any
                    other database tool, but has the added ability to run refactorings against the database.
                    As you run the refactorings, the changes are automatically saved to your db.changelog.xml files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we used the LiquiBase IDE, however, we found ourselves really wanting it as an IDE plugin.
                    We tore the code apart to abstract it for plug-in use, and it has not yet recovered.
                    We are would like to help create a plug-in for your favorite IDE, please contact us via the <a href="../community.html">mailing list</a>.
                </p>
