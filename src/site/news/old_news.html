                        primarily a bug fix release with some minor feature additions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Issues resolved include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classpath for command line migrator can now include .ear files</li>
                        <li>Can specify a "database.migrator.should.run" system property that blocks the
                            migrator from running if set to "false"</li>

                        <li>Added a net.sundog.db.migrator.servlet.MigratorStatusServlet servlet that can used to see
                            the migrator logs</li>
                        <li>Added a MIGRATOR_FAIL_ON_ERROR web.xml context parameter that controls if an exception
                            should be raised if an exception is thrown, or if the listener should just return.
                            Throws an exception by default</li>
                        <li>All database SQL is upper case.</li>

                    <h2>11/10/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.6 Released</h2>
                    <p>Version 0.6 of the LGPL Sundog Database Refactoring Tool has been released. The primary new
                        feature of this release is support for distributed locking among processes. This is
                        especially useful when using the ServletMigrator with clustered application servers or other
                        times you have multiple clients connecting to the same database.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, for some reason, a client crashes without cleaning up its lock, they can be queried and
                        removed via the command-line migrator's "-listLocks" and "-releaseLocks"
                        or by querying and updating the "DatabaseChangeLogLock" table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the locking system, this release includes several bug fixes including one that kept
                        database URLs with "=" signs in them from working.

                    </p>

                    <h2>10/18/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.5.1 Released</h2>
                    <p>Version 0.5.1 is a minor bugfix to 0.5 fixing an issue with reading the .xsd file in Ant.

                    <h2>10/16/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.5 Released, Now LGPL</h2>
                    <p>After several months of development, the Sundog Database Refactoring tool version 0.5 has been
                        released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most significant change is switching to an LGPL license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Beyond licensing changes, major changes include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Major code cleanup, including removing all 3rd party dependencies
                        </li>

                        <li>Command line migrator can be run directly against WAR and EAR files</li>
                        <li>Command line migrator can be run simply via "java -jar"</li>
                        <li>ChangeSets can be marked as "runAlways" and "runOnChange"</li>
                        <li>ServletListener can be configured to only run on certain hostnames</li>
                        <li>Improved MD5Sum generation.
                            <b>Note: the algorithm to compute MD5Sums changed thereby making existing values invalid.
                                To update your MD5Sums, run "update databasechangelog set md5sum=null" then
                                run the migrator like normal</b>
                        </li>

                        <li>Improved MySQL Support</li>
                        <li>Many additional bugfixes</li>
                        <li>Improved Documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the migrator now requires Java 5.  If there is a large cry for support of
                        1.4, that can be re-evaluated.
                    </p>

                        This initial release focuses on the migrator system which allows you to document your database
                        changes, then run it against any database via a servlet listener, ant task, or command line app.
                        We have been using the migrator in production so it should be ready for general use.
