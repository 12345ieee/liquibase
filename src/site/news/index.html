                    <h2>3/16/2007 - LiquiBase 0.7 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce LiquiBase, the newly-renamed Sundog Database Refactoring Tool.  We were never really fond of the SDRT name and finally found one we like better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 0.7 version is primarily focused around the name conversion.
                        It has a new package structure based on liquibase.* rather than net.sundog.db.*.
                        We are also working on updating our website and moving much of the project management information to
                        <a  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase">http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the name change, the following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added support for autoIncrement columns in createTableChange</li>
                        <li>Better support for multi-line SQL scripts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Note: DUE THE THE CHANGE IN MULTI-LINE SQL HANDLING, YOU MUST REBUILD YOUR MD5SUMS.
                        Execute "update databasechangelog set md5sum=null" to clear out your past md5sums.
                        They will be rebuilt with new correct new versions the next time your run the migrator.
                    </p>

                    <h2>12/12/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.6.1 Released</h2>

                    <p>Version 0.6.1 of the LGPL Sundog Database Refactoring Tool has been released.  This is
                        primarily a bug fix release with some minor feature additions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Issues resolved include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classpath for command line migrator can now include .ear files</li>
                        <li>Can specify a "database.migrator.should.run" system property that blocks the
                            migrator from running if set to "false"</li>

                        <li>Added a net.sundog.db.migrator.servlet.MigratorStatusServlet servlet that can used to see
                            the migrator logs</li>
                        <li>Added a MIGRATOR_FAIL_ON_ERROR web.xml context parameter that controls if an exception
                            should be raised if an exception is thrown, or if the listener should just return.
                            Throws an exception by default</li>
                        <li>All database SQL is upper case.</li>
                        <li>Fixed issues with postgres schemas and getTables() call</li>
                        <li>Added retroweaver build for 1.4 JVMs</li>

                    <h2>11/10/2006 - Database Refactoring Tool 0.6 Released</h2>
                    <p>Version 0.6 of the LGPL Sundog Database Refactoring Tool has been released.  The primary new
                        feature of this release is support for distributed locking among processes.  This is
                        especially useful when using the ServletMigrator with clustered application servers or other
                        times you have multiple clients connecting to the same database.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If, for some reason, a client crashes without cleaning up its lock, they can be queried and
                        removed via the command-line migrator's "-listLocks" and "-releaseLocks"
                        or by querying and updating the "DatabaseChangeLogLock" table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the locking system, this release includes several bug fixes including one that kept
                        database URLs with "=" signs in them from working.
