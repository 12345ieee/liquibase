                    <p>
                        The LiquiBase team is proud to announce version 1.0.  Since the initial release over a year ago,
                        we have worked to make it the best tool available for managing database changes and refactorings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although 1.0 is the result of over 15 previous releases, it is certainly not the end.
                        We have already implemented many new features for the upcoming 1.1 version including support for additional databases (DB2, Derby, HSQL, and more) as well as many new features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would like to thank all those who have helped with and contributed to LiquiBase so far. and hope you find
                        the tool useful.  And, as always, be sure to <a href="../community.html">let us know</a> any feedback
                        and/or feature requests you have.

                    <h2>6/19/2007 - LiquiBase 1.0 RC2 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 1.0 RC2 has been released. Changes since RC2 are primarily minor bug fixes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason for having a RC2 rather than 1.0 final is that we changed exceptions thrown by some methods and want to make sure that change does not cause any unexpected problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please report all bugs you find with the release candidate so they can be addressed in the 1.0 release, particularly in the Maven support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless there are show-stopper bugs found, the final 1.0 release should be out next week.

                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 1.0 RC1 has been released. Changes since 0.9.1 are primarily code refactoring to make sure it is a
                        clean code base to work with post-1.0.  The only new feature is a batch and shell script for easier
                        running of the command line migrator.  There were also the usual documentation improvements and bug fixes.
                    </p>

                        Please <a href="../community.html">report</a> all bugs you find with the release candidate so they can be
                        addressed in the 1.0 release, particularly in the <a href="../manual/latest/maven.html">Maven support</a>.  Unless there are show-stopper bugs found, the final 1.0 release should be out in
                        two weeks or less.

                        We have started an official <a href="http://blog.liquibase.org">LiquiBase blog</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Partly it will be a place to announce new features and releases of LiquiBase.  All announcements on this news list
                        should appear on the blog as well.

                    <p>
                        Primarily, however, it will be a place to comment on agile database development in general, best practices, and pitfalls to avoid.

                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 0.9.1 has been released. 0.9.1 is a bug-fix release that fixes bugs in the Ant migrator,
                        the command line migrator, and the "modify column" refactoring.

                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 0.9.0 has been released.  0.9.0 is feature complete and the last major release before the 1.0 release candidate series.
                        Between 0.9 and 1.0-RC1 we are going focus on bug fixes and finalizing public APIs.
                        We also hope to have a beta visual LiquiBase editor based on the <a href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/">SQuirreL SQL client</a>
                        available with the 1.0-RC1 release.  Other IDE plug-ins will become available after the 1.0 release.

                    <h3>Roll-Back Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added support for custom and auto-generated rollback statements.
                        This allows you to bring your database back to the state it was at an earlier date.

                    <h3>Maven Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added beta support for Maven.  Although we followed the documentation on the Maven
                        site for creating a plug-in, we we do not have the necessary Maven experience to actually test it well.
                        If you are interested in helping us test this functionality, please <a href="../community.html">contact us</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Command-line migrator cleanup</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have changed the format of options and commands passed to the command line migrator
                        to make it more user friendly.  We also removed logging by default, although it can be re-enabled with a flag.

                        We added additional columns to better track changes.  LiquiBase will update your DATABASECHANGLOG table
