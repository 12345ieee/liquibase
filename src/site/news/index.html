                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 0.9.1 has been released. 0.9.1 is a bug-fix release that fixes bugs in the Ant migrator,
                        the command line migrator, and the "modify column" refactoring.

                    <h2>5/14/2007 - LiquiBase 0.9.0 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        LiquiBase 0.9.0 has been released.  0.9.0 is feature complete and the last major release before the 1.0 release candidate series.
                        Between 0.9 and 1.0-RC1 we are going focus on bug fixes and finalizing public APIs.
                        We also hope to have a beta visual LiquiBase editor based on the <a href="http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/">SQuirreL SQL client</a>
                        available with the 1.0-RC1 release.  Other IDE plug-ins will become available after the 1.0 release.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Roll-Back Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added support for custom and auto-generated rollback statements.
                        This allows you to bring your database back to the state it was at an earlier date.

                    <h3>Maven Support</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added beta support for Maven.  Although we followed the documentation on the Maven
                        site for creating a plug-in, we we do not have the necessary Maven experience to actually test it well.
                        If you are interested in helping us test this functionality, please <a href="../community.html">contact us</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Command-line migrator cleanup</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have changed the format of options and commands passed to the command line migrator
                        to make it more user friendly.  We also removed logging by default, although it can be re-enabled with a flag.

                    <h3>Ant changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        We changed the "migrationFiles" parameter changed to "changeLogFile" and no longer supports multiple change-logs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>DATABASECHANGELOG table changes</h3>
                    <p>
                        We added additional columns to better track changes.  LiquiBase will update your DATABASECHANGLOG table
                        automatically.

                    <h2>4/25/2007 - LiquiBase 0.8.1 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        0.8.1 fixes a bug related to running LiquiBase without specifing an execution context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also changed prompting on non-localhost databases to be "false" by default, but made it
                        an option in the command-line migrator.

                    <p>
                        With version 0.8, we have finished the LiquiBase name change and completed our move to
                        SourceForge.
                        We have also added many useful new features including:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Change Log Preconditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Preconditions can be specified at the beginning of each change log to both document and enforce
                        assumptions the writers of the changelog had when creating it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently supported preconditions check the type of database (MySQL vs. PostgreSQL)
                        and the username of the database connection.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Execution contexts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Change Sets can now be tagged with a "context" in which to run. This allows you to control
                        which will be executed in any particular migration run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contexts can be used to ease management of test data sets and to allow you to more easily
                        create a single change log that is compatible with multiple DBMS systems.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>failOnError</h3>
                    <p>
                        ChangeSets can now have a "failOnError" attribute which controls if errors executing the
                        changeset will cause the entire database migration to fail or not.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Add/Drop Not-Null Constraints</h3>
                    <p>
                        Two new refactorings have been added: "addNotNullConstraint" and "dropNotNullConstraint"
                    </p>
                    <h3>Comment tags in change sets</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have added a "comment" tag.  Currently it is just ignored, but future releases may
                        make use of it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Improved documentation</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have officially launched <a href="http://www.liquibase.org">http://www.liquibase.org</a>
                        with greatly improved documentation.  The documentation is also included in the downloaded .zip
                        files as well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Many, Many Bug Fixes</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we approach 1.0, we have added an expanded set of unit and integration tests which have helped
                        us flush out many bugs and will continue to make sure that old issues do not resurface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would like to thank Thilak Kumar Rajaraman, Ramachandra Kadam, and Yashwanth Potla for the
                        contributions they have made to this version of LiquiBase.

                    <h2>3/16/2007 - LiquiBase 0.7 Released</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce LiquiBase, the newly-renamed Sundog Database Refactoring Tool. We were
                        never really fond of the SDRT name and finally found one we like better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 0.7 version is primarily focused around the name conversion.
                        It has a new package structure based on liquibase.* rather than net.sundog.db.*.
                        We are also working on updating our website and moving much of the project management
                        information to
                        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase">
                            http://sourceforge.net/projects/liquibase</a>
                        .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the name change, the following changes were made:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added support for autoIncrement columns in createTableChange</li>
                        <li>Better support for multi-line SQL scripts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Note: DUE THE THE CHANGE IN MULTI-LINE SQL HANDLING, YOU MUST REBUILD YOUR MD5SUMS.
                        Execute "update databasechangelog set md5sum=null" to clear out your past md5sums.
                        They will be rebuilt with new correct new versions the next time your run the migrator.
                    </p>
