                    <h2>FAQ</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>What license is LiquiBase released under?</b>
                        LiquiBase is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
                    </p>

                        <b>Where can I get the source code?</b>
                        The source is available from the main
                        <a href="download.html">download page</a>

                    <p>
                        <b>How does LiquiBase compare to tools that compare development database with
                            production databases to generate change lists?</b>
                        LiquiBase works better because it
                        <i>understands</i>
                        what the changes are. For example, a database comparison program would simply see the
                        "person" table on integration has a "firstname" and a "lastname" column, but on live, the
                        "person" table has a "name" column. It would report that you need to drop the "name"
                        column and add a "firstname" and a "lastname" column. While this would leave you with the
                        correct schema, you would lose everyone's name in the process. With LiquiBase,
                        you would have a changeset that says "rename 'name' to 'lastname' and add a 'firstname' column"
                        or, even better, "split the name column on a space and place the values in new 'firstname' and
                        'lastname' columns, then drop the 'name' column." Knowing
                        <i>why</i>
                        they are different allows changes to production databases without the fear of losing valuable
                        data.

                    <p>
                        <b>What if multiple processes/application servers attempt to migrate the database at the same
                            time?</b>
                        LiquiBase uses a distributed locking system to only allow one process to update the database
                        at a time.  The other processes will simply wait until the lock has been released.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Does LiquiBase work with branches?</b>
                        Yes. Since each change is independent, database changes that had been made in a different
                        branch, then merged in will be run the next time LiquiBase is run. You may run into a
                        problem with the order that the statements are ran, but any issues you have can be easily solved
                        by re-ordering the changelog files.
